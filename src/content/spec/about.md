# About Me
Hi, my name's Trevor. I was born and raised in Kentucky, and am proudly Appalachian. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and work as a software developer. I'm also a nerd with an interest in video games, old tech, movies, and cooking, among others. On this blog, I'll be sharing my perspective on my career, my life, and my interests. I hope that you'll find something interesting here.


The starry gif comes from a JS app that generates _EarthBound_ battle backgrounds that you can find [here](https://www.gjtorikian.com/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/). You should also play _EarthBound_ right now if you haven't already.
