Consider it a New Year's resolution, but I've decided to completely revamp my personal website and start blogging some of my ideas out into the world.

I bought the domain name for own name prior to me graduating college in 2021 (strangely, it was not a highly sought after domain name) and created a simple Bootstrap site.

This new site is built on Astro and I'm excited to learn the framework. It so far has been quite fast and simple to get started with.

I guess that's all I can really say for this introductory post. I hope to keep updating with new posts regularly. Here's to a new year!
