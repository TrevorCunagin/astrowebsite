I've updated the site to add the ability to share blog posts on various social media sites and give comments.

The social media share functionality is an Astro integration called astro-social-share that you can find here [here](https://astro-social-share.mckerlie.com/).

The comment system is called [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and while it does require a GitHub account to comment, it was by far the easiest way to implement comments and is completely free. It even includes reactions if you would like to laugh react and give me a bad day.

Finally, you can get updates for new posts through RSS. You can find the XML file at the bottom of the page. Try it out with your preferred RSS feed reader.

Thank you to those of you who read and enjoyed my previous post. I really do appreciate all of you!
